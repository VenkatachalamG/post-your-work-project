# Project Title

This project is an **interactive Python application** that explores **US bikeshare data for Chicago, New York City, and Washington**. It filters data based on **user-selected criteria—city, month, and day—and computes key usage statistics** such as popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics. The program provides a streamlined analysis loop that allows users to repeatedly run insights on different datasets.
